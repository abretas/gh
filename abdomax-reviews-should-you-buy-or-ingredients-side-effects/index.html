The nine handpicked ingredients in Abdomax come from around the world and are designed to target low pepsinogen levels to support good digestion.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">Here are all of the active ingredients in Abdomax, the science behind those ingredients, and how they work:</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block"><strong>Glucomannan Root:</strong> Glucomannan root is a popular detox and cleansing supplement ingredient, and it’s one of the most popular fiber sources in the supplement space today. According to the makers of Abdomax, glucomannan can help lower cholesterol, stabilize blood sugar levels, and raise pepsinogen levels. Because low pepsinogen is the root cause of digestive health problems, glucomannan root can help.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block"><strong>Psyllium Husk:</strong> Psyllium husk works in a similar way to glucomannan by acting as a natural source of fiber. Psyllium husk, found in many people fiber supplements, can raise pepsinogen levels, lower cholesterol, and relieve constipation and diarrhea, among other benefits. <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6358997/?utm_source=Jonas%20Lopes&amp;utm_medium=Pingback">One 2019 study</a> found psyllium husk, which is one of the largest ingredients in Abdomax by weight, supported better intestinal microbiota balance compared to a group taking a placebo.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block"><strong>Apple Pectin:</strong> Apple pectin is yet another source of fiber found in Abdomax. Apple pectin plays a critical role in the digestive process by pushing waste out of your body. Like other sources of fiber, apple pectin can form a gel in your digestive tract, helping to cleanse waste from your body. Apple pectin, according to the makers of Abdomax, also raises pepsinogen levels, promotes healthy digestion, and specifically reduces symptoms of acid reflux.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block"><strong>Bentonite Clay:</strong> Bentonite clay has been used for centuries for detoxification, cleansing, and general health and wellness. Today, many people take bentonite clay regularly for overall health and wellness. The makers of Abdomax specifically added bentonite clay to their formula for its ability to convert digestive enzymes into pepsinogen, helping to raise overall pepsinogen levels in the body and support good digestion. Bentonite clay could also help with hair health, skin health, fat burning, and belly fat, among other targeted areas.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block"><strong>Flaxseed:</strong> Abdomax contains flaxseed, a natural ingredient linked to cardiovascular health. The makers of Abdomax claim the flaxseed in the formal will lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure can reduce your risk of cardiovascular health problems.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block"><strong>Oat Bran:</strong> Oat bran has a long history of use as a natural source of fiber, and many people take oat bran as a food or supplement daily for that reason. Oat bran can increase the time it takes your body to absorb meals, which can reduce the post-meal blood sugar spike. By taking oat bran daily, you could support healthy blood sugar levels and reduce wild blood sugar swings. A 2018 study found oat bran was connected to nutrient digestibility, anti-inflammatory effects in the gut, and overall intestinal microbiota levels. <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex noopener noreferrer" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30111703/?utm_source=Jonas%20Lopes&amp;utm_medium=Pingback">The study</a> took place in pigs – not humans. However, it showed oat bran could impact gut health over a 28-day period in various ways.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block"><strong>Plum:</strong> Plum, also labeled as prune in some supplements, is a natural laxative linked to cleansing, detoxification, and digestion. Some recommend taking prune or plum when you’re struggling to cleanse your body or stay regular. The makers of Abdomax claim plum can also promote strong bones, protect against heart disease, and raise pepsinogen levels, among other effects.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block"><strong>Black Walnut Hull:</strong> Black walnut hull is known for its natural cleansing effects, and some people take black walnut hull daily as part of a cleanse. In <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/05/180503175033.htm?utm_source=Jonas%20Lopes&amp;utm_medium=Pingback">a 2018 study</a>, researchers at the University of Illinois found walnuts helped to support trillions of microbes in your gastrointestinal tract, supporting your gut’s good bacteria while helping to defend it against bad bacteria.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block"><strong>Aloe Vera:</strong> Aloe vera, like plum or prune, is also linked to natural laxative effects. Studies show aloe vera can help encourage your body’s natural digestive processes. The laxative effects are mild. However, when combined with other ingredients in Abdomax – like fiber and prune – aloe vera could help your body reduce waste and cleanse itself. Aloe vera also has unique secondary effects. According to the manufacturer, aloe vera will reduce dental plaque and increase pepsinogen production.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block"><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex noopener noreferrer" href="https://94d263pmiegmx4b5d72ddn2vf9.hop.clickbank.net/?tid=issuu">Abdomax is a 100% plant-based, soy-free, dairy-free, vegetarian, non-GMO formula</a>.

According to new research cited by the makers of Abdomax, low pepsinogen levels are the root cause of common digestive health concerns – like bloating, nausea, and indigestion.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">Specifically, pepsinogen is <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/pepsinogen?utm_source=Jonas%20Lopes&amp;utm_medium=Pingback">a digestive enzyme</a> secreted by your gastric chief cells. Your gastric chief cells secrete pepsinogen as a proenzyme. Then, your body converts that pepsinogen into pepsin, an active digestive enzyme. As you eat, pepsin goes to work to support good digestion, break down food, and help with digestive health.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">In fact, the makers of Abdomax claim pepsinogen is “one of the most important molecules” produced in your entire body because of its role in processes like:</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><ul class="cdx-block cdx-list cdx-list--unordered"><li class="cdx-list__item">Breaking down food</li><li class="cdx-list__item">Turning digested food into waste before passing it out of your body</li><li class="cdx-list__item">Keeping your colon lubricated and healthy</li><li class="cdx-list__item">Protecting your small intestines from bad bacteria</li><li class="cdx-list__item">Promoting good bacteria in your gut</li></ul></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">Because of these effects, strong pepsinogen levels are associated with strong digestion.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">As proof, the makers of Abdomax cite one study where people with normal digestion had 400% more activated pepsinogen than people with bad digestion.
