He completed his post-graduation and training for medical school at The University Of Kansas School Of Medicine. He even served the US as a civilian physician for the US Army.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">Joint health has always troubled Dr. Weis. He was concerned about the condition of joint pain treatments and often wondered why most medications don’t work permanently. So, he decided to conduct some research.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">Soon Dr. Weis found out that in a remote Japanese village named Yuzurihara, older people do not seem to experience any joint pain at all. This was all due to the extremely fertile soil of the village, where a sweet purple potato grows in abundance. The potato is rich in hyaluronan, an excellent joint-supporting component.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">Unfortunately, most joint pain supplements do not know about this component, which can eliminate stiffness and friction in the joints permanently. So, Dr. Weis decided to formulate a new dietary supplement that would include hyaluronan and other joint health-enhancing ingredients. This is how Joint Genesis was created.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block"><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex noopener noreferrer" href="https://e29afvlkhkjivb3as5onj10v98.hop.clickbank.net/?tid=pingback"><strong>Try Joint Genesis today and see the results!</strong></a></div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-header"><h2><strong>Looking At The Ingredients In Joint Genesis</strong></h2></div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">Here's what you need to know about the composition of Joint Genesis and why it is effective in the first place:</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-header"><h3><strong>Mobilee</strong></h3></div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">Mobilee joint support ingredient is a patented ingredient that is derived from natural sources.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">The active constituents of mobilee include hyaluronic acid, which is a naturally occurring substance in the body that helps lubricate and cushion joints, as well as collagen, which is a protein that provides structural support for joints and other connective tissues. Polysaccharides are complex carbohydrates that also play a role in joint health and mobility.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">Hyaluronic acid helps to lubricate joints and reduce friction, while collagen provides structural support to keep joints stable and strong. Polysaccharides help to reduce inflammation and promote healing within joint tissue.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-header"><h3><strong>Pycnogenol</strong></h3></div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">Pycnogenol contains powerful anti-inflammatory properties that can reduce inflammation in the body, including in the joints. By reducing inflammation, pycnogenol can help alleviate joint pain and stiffness.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">Pycnogenol can also increase collagen production in the body, which can improve joint health and reduce joint pain.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">It has been shown to improve blood flow in the body, including to the joints. Improved blood flow can bring essential nutrients and oxygen to the joints, which can help them function better and reduce joint-related issues.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block"><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex noopener noreferrer" href="https://e29afvlkhkjivb3as5onj10v98.hop.clickbank.net/?tid=pingback"><strong>Learn more about Joint Genesis by visiting the official website &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong></a></div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-header"><h3><strong>Ginger Root</strong></h3></div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">Ginger root is a flowering plant that originated in Southeast Asia.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">It has been shown to have significant anti-inflammatory properties, which makes it an effective natural remedy for joint pain and stiffness.

Glucosamine is a natural compound found in joint cartilage, and chondroitin is a component of connective tissue.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">Both supplements have been shown to reduce joint pain and improve joint function in people with osteoarthritis by improving the absorption of these supplements. BioPerine can enhance its effectiveness and provide greater benefits for joint health.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-header"><h3><strong>Boswellia Serrata</strong></h3></div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">Boswellia serrata, also known as Indian frankincense, is a tree native to India and the Arabian Peninsula. The resin from the tree has been used for centuries in traditional Ayurvedic medicine for its anti-inflammatory properties.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">It contains several active constituents, including boswellic acid, beta-boswellic acid, and acetyl-11-keto-beta-boswellic acid (AKBA). AKBA is believed to be the most potent of these compounds and is responsible for many of the herb's health benefits.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">Boswellia serrata works by inhibiting the production of inflammatory molecules in the body, such as leukotrienes and prostaglandins. These molecules are responsible for causing inflammation in the joints and can lead to pain, stiffness, and reduced mobility.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-header"><h2><strong>Does Joint Genesis Even Work?</strong></h2></div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">In a word, yes, Joint Genesis can relieve pain and stiffness within a few weeks. Let us tell you how.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">According to recent scientific research, the synovial fluid that is responsible for keeping your joints hydrated and friction-free begins to dry out as you age. This fluid is rich in hyaluronan, and the body slows down the production of this component as you hit 50 years. Hyaluronan ensures that the synovial fluid is functioning optimally, and this is why it is very concerning when you start to lose this element.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">So, what Joint Genesis does is enhance the body’s natural production of hyaluronan. Hyaluronan is present in multiple natural ingredients like Mobilee and Pycnogenol. The supplement uses ample amounts of these components and promotes hyaluronan levels in your body. As expected, hyaluronan then helps your synovial fluid maintain the flexibility of your joints.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">Apart from this, there are certain other herbs in the product that reduces inflammation of the joint tissue and protects your mobility.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block"><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex noopener noreferrer" href="https://e29afvlkhkjivb3as5onj10v98.hop.clickbank.net/?tid=pingback"><strong>Visit the official website now and make your purchase before it gets out of stock! &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong></a></div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-header"><h2><strong>What Health Benefits Can I Expect From Joint Genesis?</strong></h2></div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">In this section, we will take a look at the health benefits advertised by Joint Genesis.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-header"><h3><strong>Optimizes The Functioning Of Synovial Fluid</strong></h3></div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">Synovial fluid can easily dry up in older adults, and this is a major cause of joint pain and stiffness. This fluid is necessary for lubricating your joints so that movements can be friction-free. Unfortunately, this fluid needs a special element called hyaluronan to stay at its peak.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">Joint Genesis provides the synovial fluid with hyaluronan in an attempt to optimize its functioning. Hyaluronan then helps the fluid in cushioning the joints and easing knee and elbow movements.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-header"><h3><strong>Aids In Nourishing The Cartilage</strong></h3></div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">The joint cartilage acts as a cushion and ensures pain-free joint movements. The only problem in older adults is that the cartilage does not receive enough nourishment owing to declining synovial fluid levels. With age, oxygenation, nourishment, and proper blood flow to the synovial fluid are disrupted, negatively affecting the cartilage.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">This is where Joint Genesis can help. The nutrients in the unique supplement ensure proper nourishment of the joint cartilage. This further helps you to gain mobility and reduce stiffness around the joints.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-header"><h3><strong>Boosts Immunity</strong></h3></div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">Joint Genesis has multiple antioxidants that reduce inflammation around your joints. These antioxidants primarily boost the immune system to achieve this effect. Your immunity is responsible for dealing with inflamed areas in your body, but with age, your immune system goes through a setback. Joint Genesis tries to enhance your weakened immunity in an attempt to eliminate inflammation.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-header"><h3><strong>Eliminates Free Radicals</strong></h3></div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">Free radicals are toxins that are everywhere. You cannot avoid them; they adversely affect tissues, including those in your joints. This causes pain, inflammation, and oxidative stress around the joints.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">Thankfully, the antioxidants in Joint Genesis promptly remove these free radicals through neutralization. As you consume the capsules daily, the ingredients keep attacking the free radicals until they are flushed out of your system.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block"><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex noopener noreferrer" href="https://e29afvlkhkjivb3as5onj10v98.hop.clickbank.net/?tid=pingback"><strong>Buy now and enjoy all the benefits of Joint Genesis!</strong></a></div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-header"><h2><strong>A Review Of The Clinical Backing Of Joint Genesis Supplement</strong></h2></div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">Boswellia serrata is one of the many effective ingredients in Joint Genesis.

After a couple of weeks with no improvement, I was in tears, thinking my running days were over. I refused to accept that and hit Google to find my solution, and that's when I came across this joint support. After 4 days of taking them, I could feel the pain start to dissipate. I would go out every night and try to jog, and on day 10, I finally could.
