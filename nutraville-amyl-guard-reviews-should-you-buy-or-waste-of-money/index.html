With societal pressures to conform to certain beauty standards, it's no wonder that many women feel immense pressure to lose weight. Additionally, hormonal changes and biological factors can make weight loss a more difficult process for women. Women often have to juggle work, family, and social obligations, leaving little time for exercise and meal preparation.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">Some try tough keto diets and follow a healthy lifestyle but get no significant results.

Do you know why? Because these supplements do not deal with the root cause of body weight. But what is the cause?</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">Well, it's a secret enzyme called Amylase. Amylase is an enzyme that plays an important role in the digestive process by breaking down complex carbohydrates into simple sugars. When you are in your 30s and 40s, the levels of Amylase rise. When there is an excess of Amylase in the body, it can lead to an increase in the absorption of carbohydrates, which can lead to weight gain. Some people may have a genetic predisposition to producing higher levels of Amylase, which can make losing weight more difficult.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">However, the good news is that there is an ancient Okinawan formula called <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex noopener noreferrer" href="https://d7dba5rbtlfow894zkpdy8z5du.hop.clickbank.net/?tid=pingback">Amyl Guard</a> that ensures a healthy production of Amylase to boost metabolism and help women lose weight.

One of the main causes of weight gain in women after the age of 30 is high levels of Amylase. Amylase is an enzyme that helps break down carbohydrates in the body.
