To protect the same and prevent issues related to the prostate gland, Fluxactive Complete uses the following ingredients:</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-header"><h3>Catuaba</h3></div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">The Catuaba plant contains components that have been shown in animal studies to increase testosterone levels by as much as 50%. Catuaba also appears to be effective against ED and may even help with premature ejaculation. It is thought that Catuaba works by increasing blood flow to the unit during arousal, thus helping men achieve stronger outcomes.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">It is believed to work by stimulating nitric oxide production in the body. Nitric oxide helps relax smooth muscle cells in the walls of blood vessels, allowing more blood to flow through them. In addition, Catuaba increases the amount of oxygen carried to the tissues of the unit, resulting in firmer actions.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">There are no known side effects associated with Catuaba use. However, you should always check with your doctor before starting any new supplements or medications, including Fluxactive Complete.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-header"><h3>Damiana</h3></div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">Damiana is another herb commonly used to treat male impotence. Damiana has been found to improve both mental and physical aspects of intercourse and can help men who suffer from low drive. It is believed that damiana helps to regulate hormones and therefore increases testosterone production.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">Damiana is often referred to as “the aphrodisiac” because it is said to stimulate the body’s natural desire to make love. In addition to its ability to boost testosterone, damiana is also reported to increase energy levels, improve mood, and enhance overall well-being.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">A study published in the Journal of Ethnopharmacology suggests that damiana may actually work better than Viagra® when treating ED. Researchers tested the effects of damiana on rats and found that it increased their testosterone levels by up to 40% more than Viagra® while having little or no negative impact on heart rate or blood pressure.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">In fact, the researchers concluded that damiana might be safer than Viagra® since it doesn’t produce the same level of side effects.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">It is important to note that damiana is not recommended for women due to its estrogenic properties.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-header"><h3>Chinese Ginseng</h3></div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">Ginseng is one of the most popular herbs used to promote a healthy performance. There are many different types of ginseng available, but the two most common forms are American ginseng and Asian ginseng. Both types contain compounds called saponins, which are responsible for the medicinal benefits of ginseng.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">Saponins are considered to be the primary active ingredient in ginseng, although they do not appear to be directly responsible for its aphrodisiac qualities. Instead, it is thought that these compounds interact with the brain to create feelings of happiness and relaxation.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-header"><h3>Saw Palmetto</h3></div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">Saw palmetto is a type of palm tree native to North America. Its berries have traditionally been used to relieve symptoms of prostate enlargement. Saw palmetto is now widely accepted as a safe treatment option for BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia), a condition where the prostate gland becomes enlarged.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">The main active ingredients in saw palmetto are fatty acids, specifically phytosterols. These substances have been shown to reduce inflammation and inhibit the growth of cancer cells. They also appear to have antiandrogenic properties, meaning that they block the action of testosterone. This means that saw palmetto may be able to prevent the development of prostate cancer.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-header"><h3>Muira Puama</h3></div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">Muira puama bark has long been used in South America as a remedy for urinary tract infections. It contains high amounts of tannin, which helps to strengthen the walls of your bladder and urethra. Tannins can help to remove toxins from the body, so muira pauma bark may also help to treat conditions such as cystitis and UTIs.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">There is some evidence suggesting that muira pauma bark might also be effective in preventing prostate cancer.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">Muira pauma works by stimulating the production of nitric oxide in the body. Nitric oxide is a chemical compound that plays an important role in blood flow throughout the body.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">This increased blood flow leads to better intercourse quality and stronger finishing.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-header"><h3>Tribulus</h3></div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">Prostate health is very closely linked to male fertility. In fact, there’s even a name for the condition: “prostatism.” Prostate problems can cause infertility, low sperm count, poor semen quality, and painful intercourse.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">Tribulus Terrestris is a plant commonly found in India and Asia. It contains several chemicals that have been shown to improve prostate health. One of these chemicals is protodioscin, which appears to increase levels of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone. This improves the chances of conception and increases sperm count.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">Another compound found in Tribulus Terrestris is zerumbone, which has been shown to reduce the size of prostate tumors.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-header"><h3>Oat Straw</h3></div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">Oats contain many nutrients that promote healthy prostate tissue. Oatmeal is rich in beta-glucan fiber, which promotes regularity and reduces the risk of prostate cancer. Beta-glucan fiber also lowers cholesterol and triglycerides.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">Beta-glucans are polysaccharides made up of glucose molecules. They are similar to cellulose but much smaller. Cellulose is one of the building blocks of plants. It makes up the cell walls of all living things.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">These components are known to stimulate immune system activity.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">Oat straw also contains vitamin E, which protects against free radical damage.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-header"><h2><strong>Benefits Of Fluxactive Complete</strong></h2></div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">Fluxactive Complete is a complete dietary supplement that is formed of herbal extracts.
