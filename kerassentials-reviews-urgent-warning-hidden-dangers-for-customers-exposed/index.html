class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">The Kerasentials is a multi-functional product that not only removes toenail fungus but also supports the overall health of your skin and nails. It is a unique blend of natural ingredients that work together to eliminate fungal infections, improve skin hydration and strengthen nails.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">Kerassentials, made with essential oils, are an effective solution to this problem. The ingredients include tea tree oil, lavender oil, and flaxseed oil, known for their antifungal properties. These oils penetrate the nails and skin to target the root cause of the infection, eliminating the fungus and preventing its spread.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">Not only does it get rid of the fungus, but it also supports the overall health of your skin and nails. It nourishes the skin with moisturizing ingredients like DL-alpha-Tocopherol and Undecylenic Acid. These ingredients provide hydration, prevent dryness, and improve the skin's elasticity.

Many people have been struggling with brittle nails and skin, nail fungus, itching, and foul smell even after trying a number of diets and supplements.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">This is because the root cause of poor nail health is the remaining fungus, which starts growing again after completing your medication and antibiotic course. According to them, sometimes medications create stronger fungal infections because fungus learns how to survive in your skin and nails. This situation makes it almost impossible to treat nail fungus.</div></div></div><div class="editor-block"><div class="editor-block__content"><div class="ce-paragraph cdx-block">Kerassentials work by offering you rid of itching, foul smell, and toe fungal infections. This product targets the root cause of toenail fungus and itching around the skin of your nails.
